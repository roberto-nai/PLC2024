## Abstract

In comparative law, standardization and harmonization of law are interrelated concepts that aim to increase legal certainty, efficiency, and accessibility. Standardization focuses on creating uniform rules and procedures within a specific jurisdiction, while harmonization seeks to align legal frameworks across jurisdictions. This research aims to investigate the impact of standardization and harmonization on legal systems through the application of AI methods. Two case studies were analyzed using machine learning, natural language processing, and process mining techniques. The paper also reports a brief discussion of the methods adopted and early results from two legal domain experts.
